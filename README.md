# Touch-Table-Visualization

This allows multiple users to interact with the map, statewise through popups. The state level visualizations are independent with each other. The visulaized data are:
* Social Vulnerability Index
* National Disaster Risk Index
* Sea level Rise
* High Risk Flood 

Single user mode is yet to be deployed..
